Big data is a broad term for data sets so large or complex that traditional data processing applications are inadequate. Challenges include analysis, capture, data curation, search, sharing, storage, transfer, visualization, and information privacy.
The term often refers simply to the use of predictive analytics or other certain advanced methods to extract value from data, and seldom to a particular size of data set.
Accuracy in big data may lead to more confident decision making. And better decisions can mean greater operational efficiency, cost reduction and reduced risk.
Analysis of data sets can find new correlations, to "spot business trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and so on".Scientists, business executives, practitioners of media and advertising and governments alike regularly meet difficulties with large data sets in areas including Internet search, finance and business informatics.
Scientists encounter limitations in e-Science work, including meteorology, genomics, connectomics, complex physics simulations and biological and environmental research.
Work with big data is necessarily uncommon; most analysis is of "PC size" data, on a desktop PC or notebook that can handle the available data set.
